This is the folder contains the experiments taken on notebook. We recomend you play the sal on notebook, but run ksal on gpu if the dataset is large. 
You can check the ksal.py in src folder and how does a submission script should look like. Please save the model in npz follows ksal.py then play the experiments on notebook with the saved model.
